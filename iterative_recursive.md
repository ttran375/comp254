# Iterative vs Recursive

```java
public class BinarySearchExample {
    public static boolean binarySearch(int[] data, int target, int low, int high) {
        if (low > high) // interval empty; no match
            return false;
        else {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (target == data[mid]) // found a match
                return true;
            else if (target < data[mid])
                return binarySearch(data, target, low, mid - 1); // recur left of the middle
            else
                return binarySearch(data, target, mid + 1, high); // recur right of the middle
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 };
        int target = 15;

        boolean found = binarySearch(data, target, 0, data.length - 1);
        if (found) {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " found in the array.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found in the array.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Recursive Approach (current implementation)

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity**: The recursive approach is often more straightforward and easier to understand.
2. **Clarity**: The logic of binary search (dividing the array and searching in the subarrays) is clearly visible.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Stack Overflow**: If the array is large, the recursive calls might lead to a stack overflow error due to deep recursion.
2. **Overhead**: Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, which can be less efficient in terms of memory and speed compared to iteration.

## Iterative Approach

**Advantages:**

1. **Efficiency**: No overhead of recursive calls, which can be more memory efficient.
2. **Avoid Stack Overflow**: Works better with large datasets as it avoids the risk of stack overflow.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Complexity**: The iterative approach can be slightly more complex to implement and understand.
2. **Code Readability**: The logic of the binary search might be less apparent compared to the recursive version.

Here's how the iterative version of the binary search would look in Java:

```java
public class BinarySearchExample {
    public static boolean binarySearch(int[] data, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = data.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (data[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (data[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false; // target not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 };
        int target = 15;

        boolean found = binarySearch(data, target);
        if (found) {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " found in the array.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Target " + target + " not found in the array.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

- **For smaller datasets** where the risk of stack overflow is minimal, the recursive approach is perfectly fine and easier to understand.
- **For larger datasets** or when performance and memory efficiency are critical, the iterative approach is generally preferable.

Given these considerations, if your primary concern is readability and the dataset isn't excessively large, the recursive approach is suitable. However, if you're dealing with potentially large datasets or require optimal performance, the iterative approach is recommended.
