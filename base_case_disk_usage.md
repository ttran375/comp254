```
Algorithm DiskUsage(path):
    Input: A string designating a path to a file-system entry
    Output: The cumulative disk space used by that entry and any nested entries
    
    total = size(path)  {immediate disk space used by the entry}
    
    if path represents a directory then
        for each child entry stored within directory path do
            total = total + DiskUsage(child)  {recursive call}
    
    return total
```

The implicit base case in the `DiskUsage` algorithm is when the `path` represents a file rather than a directory. In this case, the algorithm simply returns the size of the file without making any recursive calls.

Here's a detailed explanation of the implicit base case:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to the size of the `path`, which represents the immediate disk space used by the entry (file or directory).

2. **Directory Check**: The algorithm checks if `path` represents a directory. If it does, it proceeds to the recursive part.

3. **Implicit Base Case**: If `path` does not represent a directory (i.e., it is a file), the algorithm does not enter the loop and does not make any recursive calls. It directly returns the `total`, which is the size of the file.

The implicit base case is thus the scenario where `path` is a file, and the function returns its size immediately.

Here is a Python-like pseudocode for better understanding:

```python
def DiskUsage(path):
    # Initialize total with the immediate disk space used by the entry
    total = size(path)
    
    # If path represents a directory
    if is_directory(path):
        # Iterate through each child entry in the directory
        for child in directory_entries(path):
            # Recursive call and accumulate the total size
            total += DiskUsage(child)
    
    # Return the cumulative disk space used by the entry and nested entries
    return total
```

In this pseudocode:

- `size(path)` returns the size of the file or directory at `path`.
- `is_directory(path)` checks if `path` is a directory.
- `directory_entries(path)` returns a list of child entries in the directory.

The implicit base case occurs when `is_directory(path)` is `False`, meaning `path` is a file. In this case, the function simply returns the size of the file.
